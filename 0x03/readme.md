# Introduction to Chai Assertions

## Chai
+ Chai is such an assertion library, which provides certain interfaces to implement assertions for any JavaScript-based framework.
+ Chai's interfaces are broadly classified into two: 
   + TDD styles
      - TDD also known as test-driven development, provides more of a classical feel.
      - Interfaces: <strong>Assert</strong>
   + BDD styles.
      - BDD, also known as behavior-driven development language, provides an expressive language and readable style
      - Interfaces; <strong>Expect</strong> and <strong>should</strong>
